Agent: Thank you for calling Maersk Logistics, this is Priya. How may I help you today?
Customer: I'm honestly very frustrated! My container was supposed to arrive three days ago, and I still don't have any updates!
Agent: I'm sorry to hear that, sir. Could you provide me the container number so I can check the status?
Customer: It's MAEU7894561. I've been calling every day, and no one gives me a clear answer!
Agent: I understand how frustrating that must be. Let me check your shipment details… yes, I can see the container is currently held at Nhava Sheva port awaiting customs clearance.
Customer: Customs clearance? Why wasn't I informed about this? My production line is stopped because of this delay!
Agent: I apologize for the lack of communication. It appears there was a documentation issue that's causing the delay.
Customer: Documentation issue? We submitted everything correctly! Are you people even checking properly or just making excuses?
Agent: I assure you, sir, we take every case seriously. I can see that our customs team is working to resolve this, but it may take 2-3 more business days.
Customer: 2-3 more days?! That's unacceptable! I'm losing thousands of rupees every day. I need this resolved immediately!
Agent: I completely understand your concern. Unfortunately, customs procedures are beyond our direct control, but I can escalate this to our port operations manager.
Customer: Escalate it then! This is ridiculous. I pay premium rates for your services and this is what I get?
Agent: I will escalate your case right away, sir. Would you like me to transfer you to my supervisor immediately?
Customer: Yes, do it now. I want to speak to someone who can actually help me, not just give me excuses.
Agent: Understood, sir. I'll transfer your call to my supervisor immediately. Please hold.

You are analyzing a customer service call transcript. Follow these steps in order to produce a structured JSON report.

IMPORTANT: Include a "reasoning" section showing your step-by-step thought process.

<transcript>
{call_transcript}
</transcript>

## Analysis Steps

**Step 1: Validate Data Sufficiency**
First, determine if the transcript contains enough information for analysis.
Return INSUFFICIENT_DATA if ANY of these conditions are true:
- Fewer than 3 meaningful exchanges between agent and customer
- Customer's issue or intent is completely unclear
- Transcript is severely garbled, incomplete, or has major language barriers

If insufficient, output ONLY:
{{
  "status": "INSUFFICIENT_DATA",
  "reason": "brief explanation of why data is insufficient"
}}

**Step 2: Analyze Sentiment & Tone**
Evaluate the emotional aspects of the interaction:
- Overall sentiment trajectory (positive/neutral/negative/mixed)
- Customer's emotional state throughout the call
- Agent's tone and approach

**Step 3: Classify the Interaction**
Identify:
- Type of interaction (complaint/inquiry/request/feedback/technical_support/other)
- Customer's primary intent
- Key topics or themes discussed
- Urgency and severity levels
- Whether escalation would be beneficial
- Presence of inappropriate language

**Step 4: Summarize Key Information**
Capture:
- The core customer issue
- What resolution or guidance was provided
- Whether follow-up action is needed

## Output Requirements

- **Confidentiality**: Exclude all PII (names, phone numbers, emails, account numbers, addresses)
- **Brevity**: Keep each text field under 100 characters
- **Format**: Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown code blocks or extra text
- **Tone**: Professional and objective

Question:
A Maersk vessel is loading containers at Mumbai port. The vessel can carry 150 containers total.
Currently loaded: 60% are 40ft containers (each weighs 28 tons), and 40% are 20ft containers (each weighs 15 tons).
The vessel's maximum weight capacity is 3500 tons.
Is the vessel overloaded?

Student's Solution:
150 containers × 28 tons = 4200 tons
4200 tons > 3500 tons maximum capacity
Therefore: YES, the vessel is OVERLOADED.
