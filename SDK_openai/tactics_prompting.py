# Principal1 : Write clear and specific Instructions (Not necssarily short,sometimes longer prompts give more context to LLMs to give better responses)

# Tactic 1: Use delimiters
# - Triple quotes: """
# - Triple backticks: ```
# - Triple dashes: ---
# - Angle brackets: < >
# - XML tags: <tag> </tag>

# principal 2 : Give the model time to think


# in python \ is uded to break a line into multiple lines
# Tactic 1: Use delimiters to clearly separate instructions from content

# INCIDENT REPORT - IR-2024-1156

# Date/Time: November 15, 2024, 14:30 IST
# Reported By: Rajesh Kumar, Operations Manager, Mumbai Port
# Vessel: MV Maersk Dhaka (Voyage: 424N)
# Container(s): MAEU4567891, MAEU4567892, MAEU4567893

# INCIDENT DESCRIPTION:
# On November 15, 2024, at approximately 14:30 hours, three refrigerated containers 
# experienced power failure during loading operations at Jawaharlal Nehru Port, Mumbai. 
# The containers were being loaded onto MV Maersk Dhaka for shipment to Rotterdam.

# The power failure occurred due to a faulty reefer plug connection at Bay 14, Row 3. 
# The electrical team identified that the plug socket had corroded contacts, causing 
# intermittent power supply. Temperature monitoring showed that container MAEU4567891 
# (containing pharmaceutical products) experienced a temperature rise from -20°C to -12°C 
# over a 45-minute period before the issue was detected.

# CARGO DETAILS:
# - MAEU4567891: Pharmaceutical products (temperature-sensitive vaccines) - Customer: PharmaCorp Ltd
# - MAEU4567892: Frozen seafood products - Customer: Ocean Harvest Exports
# - MAEU4567893: Fresh fruits (mangoes) - Customer: Global Foods Trading

# IMMEDIATE ACTIONS TAKEN:
# 1. All three containers were immediately disconnected and moved to standby reefer area
# 2. Alternative power connections were arranged within 20 minutes
# 3. Temperature monitoring confirmed MAEU4567892 and MAEU4567893 maintained required temperatures
# 4. Container MAEU4567891 temperature stabilized at -18°C after 1 hour
# 5. Electrical maintenance team replaced the faulty socket at Bay 14, Row 3
# 6. Customer PharmaCorp Ltd was notified of the temperature excursion

# IMPACT ASSESSMENT:
# - Vessel departure delayed by 3 hours (original ETD: 18:00, revised ETD: 21:00)
# - 45 minutes of temperature excursion for pharmaceutical cargo
# - Customer PharmaCorp requesting cargo inspection before acceptance
# - Potential insurance claim for compromised pharmaceutical products
# - Estimated financial exposure: USD 75,000 (cargo value) + USD 12,000 (delay costs)

# CURRENT STATUS:
# - Containers MAEU4567892 and MAEU4567893 loaded successfully with normal parameters
# - Container MAEU4567891 on hold pending customer decision and quality inspection
# - Third-party surveyor scheduled for November 16, 2024, 09:00 hours
# - Port authority notified, incident logged in port safety system
# - Equipment maintenance team conducting full audit of all reefer connections in Bay 14

# NEXT STEPS REQUIRED:
# 1. Await surveyor report on pharmaceutical cargo condition (Due: Nov 16, 17:00)
# 2. Coordinate with customer for final decision on cargo acceptance/rejection
# 3. If rejected: arrange alternative transportation or return to shipper
# 4. Complete root cause analysis on electrical infrastructure
# 5. Update vessel schedule and notify all downstream ports of revised ETA
# 6. Process insurance documentation if cargo claim is filed

# ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
# Preliminary investigation indicates inadequate preventive maintenance schedule for reefer 
# plug sockets in high-humidity areas. Last maintenance of Bay 14 sockets was conducted 
# 8 months ago, exceeding the recommended 6-month interval for coastal port facilities.

# RESPONSIBLE PARTIES:
# - Port Operations: Rajesh Kumar (Incident Commander)
# - Electrical Maintenance: Suresh Patil (Technical Lead)
# - Customer Service: Priya Sharma (Account Manager - PharmaCorp)
# - Claims & Insurance: Amit Desai (Claims Coordinator)

Agent: Good morning, thank you for calling Maersk customer service. This is Priya speaking. 
May I have your company name and booking reference number please?

Customer: Yes, hello. This is Ramesh Kumar from TechWorld Exports Private Limited, Mumbai.

Agent: Thank you Mr. Ramesh. How can I help you today?

Customer: We have booking with you, the reference number is... let me check... yes, 
MAEU20241115. Actually we are having some problems with this booking.

Agent: Okay, let me pull up that booking. MAEU20241115... yes I can see it. This is for 
one 40-foot dry container from Mumbai to Hamburg, loading date November 18th on vessel 
MV Maersk Edinburgh. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes yes, that's the one. But see, we have two problems now. First thing is, 
our cargo specification has changed. Originally we were shipping electronic components in 
dry container, but now supplier changed and we received pharmaceutical raw materials which 
needs temperature control. So we need reefer container now, not dry container.

Agent: I understand. So you need equipment type change from dry to refrigerated container.

Customer: Yes, exactly. And second problem is customs. Yesterday we got notice from customs 
department that our export documents having some errors in HS code classification. We need 
to resubmit corrected documents. This will take minimum 2 to 3 days. So we cannot load on 
18th November. We need to push loading date to 21st November.

Agent: Alright, so two changes needed - equipment change from dry to reefer, and reschedule 
loading from 18th to 21st November. Let me check vessel schedule... MV Maersk Edinburgh 
departs 19th November, so you'll miss that sailing anyway.

Customer: Oh no, what is next available vessel?

Agent: Next vessel on same route is MV Maersk Copenhagen departing 23rd November. Would that work?

Customer: Hmm, let me think... yes okay, that should be fine. Our customer in Hamburg is 
already informed there will be some delay. But this is very urgent for us because we have 
penalty clause in contract. Every day delay is costing us money.

Agent: I completely understand Mr. Ramesh. I will mark this as high priority ticket. Can I 
confirm your registered email address - is it contact@techworld.in?

Customer: No no, that's old email. Please use ramesh.kumar@techworld-exports.com. That's my 
direct email. I need confirmation quickly.

Agent: Noted, ramesh.kumar@techworld-exports.com. I'm creating high priority ticket right now 
for equipment change and schedule modification. You will receive confirmation email within 
one hour with new booking details.

Customer: Okay good. And what about additional charges for reefer container? Will it be more expensive?

Agent: Yes, there will be price difference because reefer containers have higher rates. The 
commercial team will send you revised quotation along with confirmation. They will contact you 
within 2 hours.

Customer: Alright, please make sure they contact fast. We need to finalize everything today only.

Agent: Absolutely. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's all. Just please process this urgently.

Agent: Definitely Mr. Ramesh. Your ticket reference number is TKT-2024-8821. You'll receive 
all details on your email shortly. Thank you for calling Maersk.

Customer: Thank you, bye.

# Why this tactic is important?
# This demonstrates conditional logic in prompts. The LLM evaluates multiple conditions:
# 1. Is container available at preferred location? → Confirm
# 2. Available elsewhere? → Suggest transfer
# 3. Not available anywhere? → Escalate to operations
# This is useful for decision-making workflows, approval systems, and intelligent routing.

# Tactic 4: Few-shot prompting
# Use case: Classify customer feedback sentiment in shipping/logistics context
# Few-shot examples teach the LLM industry-specific sentiment rules that differ from general sentiment

prompt = f"""
You are analyzing customer feedback for Maersk's shipping operations. 

In the shipping industry, sentiment classification has SPECIAL RULES:
- "Delay" is ALWAYS negative, even if customer says "only" or "just"
- "Early arrival" is ALWAYS positive
- "Vessel change" can be neutral if no delay mentioned
- "Additional charges" is ALWAYS negative
- "Proactive communication" is ALWAYS positive

Classify sentiment as: POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL

<example_1>
Feedback: "Container arrived 2 days early, very happy with service"
Sentiment: POSITIVE
Reason: Early arrival
</example_1>

<example_2>
Feedback: "There was only a small delay of 6 hours, but team kept us informed throughout"
Sentiment: NEGATIVE
Reason: Any delay is negative in shipping, despite positive communication
</example_2>

<example_3>
Feedback: "Vessel changed from MV Maersk Delhi to MV Maersk Mumbai, same ETA maintained"
Sentiment: NEUTRAL
Reason: Vessel change with no schedule impact
</example_3>

<example_4>
Feedback: "Received additional detention charges bill today"
Sentiment: NEGATIVE
Reason: Unexpected charges are always frustrating
</example_4>

<example_5>
Feedback: "Your team proactively called us before the issue escalated, great service"
Sentiment: POSITIVE
Reason: Proactive communication is valued highly
</example_5>

Now classify this feedback:

Feedback: "Shipment had just 4-hour delay at port, but honestly your customer service kept updating us every hour, so we weren't stressed"

# Why Few-shot Prompting is critical here?
# 
# WITHOUT few-shot: LLM sees "but honestly", "great customer service", "weren't stressed"
# → Classifies as POSITIVE (generic sentiment analysis)
#
# WITH few-shot: LLM learns "ANY delay = NEGATIVE in shipping industry"
# → Classifies as NEGATIVE (industry-specific rules)
#
# Few-shot examples teach domain-specific logic that contradicts general language patterns.
# This is essential for:
# - Industry-specific classification systems
# - Custom business rules that differ from common sense
# - Context-dependent interpretation
# - Training without fine-tuning the model


#  Recap in This Lesson we learned Very Important Prompting Techniques like\
#  how we need to be specific in our instructions (Use Tactics 1), \
#  Define the structure of output (Use Tactics 2), \
#  Ask the model to verify whether certain conditions are met (Use Tactics 3),\
